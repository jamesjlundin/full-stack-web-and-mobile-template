# AI Provider Configuration (at least one API key required for AI features)
# Set API keys for the providers you want to enable. The app will automatically
# detect which providers are available based on which keys are set.
# If no keys are set, a mock streaming response will be used for demo purposes.

# Resend Email Configuration (Required in production for email verification)
# In development (NODE_ENV !== "production"), verification tokens are echoed in API responses for testing.
# In production with RESEND_API_KEY set, verification emails are sent via Resend.

# MAIL_FROM must be a verified sender/domain in Resend (e.g., "Your App <no-reply@yourdomain.com>")
MAIL_FROM="Your App <no-reply@yourdomain.com>"
# APP_BASE_URL is used for auth and verification links (e.g., ${APP_BASE_URL}/auth/verify?token=...)

# Cron Job Authentication (REQUIRED in production)
# Vercel automatically sends this as Authorization: Bearer header when invoking cron jobs.
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
# In development, a fallback is used if not set. In production, cron jobs will be
# rejected if CRON_SECRET is not configured.

# Rate Limiting - Upstash Redis (REQUIRED in production for effective rate limiting)
# Create a Redis database via Vercel Marketplace → Upstash → Upstash for Redis
# These variables are automatically set when you connect the database to your Vercel project.
# For local development, rate limiting falls back to in-memory storage (not persistent).
